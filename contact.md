      ### So... wanna talk business?


      Great.


      Here is my "ideal wife/client":


      (1) Personality match - business is personal, life is too short to not
      enjoy working together. So from everything you've seen/read/watched about
      me, why me specifically? :-)


      (2) Let me know what you're selling. Hopefully it's not [arsenic disguised
      as children's food](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEOGrkhDp0) (but I do
      love a good challenge!)


      (3) You team up with me for my expertise. It's OK to disagree, but you
      recognize that my **focus is on results ($$$)**, not to please some
      corporate Boba-Bola board arguing whether it's best to put on their
      billboards a Vanilla Caucasian or a Gay, Black & Jewish person who
      identifies as a Comanche Helicopter for better "representation".


      If none of these scare you off, I would love to know about your project.
